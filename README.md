# ECE-GY 6463 Advanced Hardware Design


This course was about how a hardware-description language (Verilog, VHDL) can be used for computer hardware modeling, logic synthesis, register-level synthesis and simulation. The resulting design with hundreds or thousands of gates is then ready to be downloaded to form FPGA chips or silicon cells. A design project is required and students make a written and oral presentation.
